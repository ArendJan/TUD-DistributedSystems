# Other Stuff [&uarr;](./../README.md)

## Progress

* Decide for a paper
* Initial design
* Set up a GitHub repository
* Getting scala + akka + IDE up and running
* Implement the basic functionality
* view changes
* timeouts
* signing&certificates
* running in a distributed fashion (multiple computers)
* adding meaningful payload to transactions for testing
* thinking about how to evaluate
* implementing code for evaluation & evaluate
* report writing
* report review
* submission :)

## Questions to be answered

* (some images like state diagram similar to WS-AT) (ONE image added so far)
* image of our system structure (? including what messages are sent and a small number that explains in what order they are sent)
* What are the big differences to WS-AT (Partialy done)
* What was our additional plan?
* What steps did we take to implement it / how often and why have we changed our plan?
* Why have we implemented it the way it is implemented?
* What would we do different
* What is working well in our implementation  (Everything?)
* What is working not so well in our implementation (Not implemented parts?)
* compared to the paper, what have we left out? (Not left anything out. )
* If we did more than the paper, what? (Maybe view changes??)
* did we decide to do anything different than the paper? (No?)
* discussion of usecases for a (BFT) commit protocol     (Partial done)
* listing a few different ways how we could evaluate our system (e.g. performance) and some short discussion

## Milestone 2

>Dear All,
>
>Please remember that the deadline for the 2nd milestone of the group project (implementation) is March 20th.
>
>At this stage, most of the core functionalities that you identified in the previous step should be implemented. The next step is to think about how your system can be evaluated. Please send me your codebase along side a short report that discusses how you are going to evaluate the implemented system. (e.g., what metrics, what is the setup, which experiments, etc.)
