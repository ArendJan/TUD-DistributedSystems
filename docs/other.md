## Questions to be answered

* (some images like state diagram similar to WS-AT)
* image of our system structure (? including what messages are sent and a small number that explains in what order they are sent)
* What are the big differences to WS-AT
* What was our additional plan?
* What steps did we take to implement it / how often and why have we changed our plan?
* Why have we implemented it the way it is implemented?
* What would we do different
* What is working well in our implementation
* What is working not so well in our implementation
* compared to the paper, what have we left out?
* If we did more than the paper, what?
* did we decide to do anything different than the paper?
* discussion of usecases for a (BFT) commit protocol
* listing a few different ways how we could evaluate our system (e.g. performance) and some short discussion
